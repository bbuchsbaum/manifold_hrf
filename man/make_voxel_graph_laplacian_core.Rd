\arguments{
\item{voxel_coords_matrix}{V x 3 matrix of voxel coordinates}

\item{num_neighbors_Lsp}{number of nearest neighbours}

\item{distance_engine}{Choice of distance computation engine. "euclidean"
performs an exact search while "ann_euclidean" uses approximate nearest
neighbors via the \pkg{RcppHNSW} package. If the package is not available
and this option is selected, the function falls back to the exact search
with a warning.}

\item{ann_threshold}{When \code{distance_engine = "euclidean"}, use the
approximate search for datasets larger than this threshold if
\pkg{RcppHNSW} is installed.}

\value{
L_sp_sparse_matrix A V x V sparse Laplacian matrix (Matrix::sparseMatrix)

sparse V x V graph Laplacian matrix
}
\description{
Creates a sparse graph Laplacian matrix for spatial smoothing based on
k-nearest neighbors in 3D voxel space.
}
\details{
This function implements Component 2, Step 1 of the M-HRF-LSS pipeline.
It constructs a k-nearest neighbor graph from voxel coordinates and computes
the normalized graph Laplacian L = D - W, where W is the adjacency matrix
and D is the degree matrix. The resulting Laplacian is used for spatial
smoothing of manifold coordinates.
If \code{distance_engine = "ann_euclidean"} but the required
\pkg{RcppHNSW} package is missing, the function silently falls back to the
exact search and issues a warning.
