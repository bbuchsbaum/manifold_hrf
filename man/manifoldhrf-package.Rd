\title{manifoldhrf: Manifold Methods for Hemodynamic Response Function Analysis}
\description{
This package provides manifold learning methods for analyzing hemodynamic response functions (HRF) in neuroimaging data. It implements dimensionality reduction techniques and manifold-based approaches for understanding HRF patterns and dynamics. The package includes a complete pipeline for manifold-guided HRF estimation and trial-wise deconvolution (M-HRF-LSS) with support for neuroimaging data formats.
