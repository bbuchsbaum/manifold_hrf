\title{Create a simple logger}
\usage{
create_logger()
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mhrf_logger} with methods \code{add} and \code{get}.
}
\description{
The logger accumulates messages, warnings and decisions during the
analysis pipeline. Messages are timestamped for reproducibility.
}
\details{
\strong{Thread Safety Warning}: This logger is NOT thread-safe. When using
parallel processing (e.g., with future, parallel, or foreach), logger
methods should only be called from the main thread. Calling logger
methods from worker threads may result in lost messages or race conditions.

For parallel processing scenarios, consider:
\itemize{
\item Collecting messages in each worker and returning them to the main thread
\item Using the logger only before and after parallel sections
\item Implementing a thread-safe logging solution if concurrent logging is critical
}
}
