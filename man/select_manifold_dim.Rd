\title{Select manifold dimensionality based on eigenvalues}
\usage{
select_manifold_dim(eigenvalues, min_var = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{eigenvalues}{Numeric vector of eigenvalues from the Markov matrix
(ordered by magnitude). The first element is assumed to be the trivial
eigenvalue equal to 1.}

\item{min_var}{Minimum cumulative variance to retain (between 0 and 1).}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{m_auto}: Selected dimensionality.
\item \code{cum_var}: Cumulative variance explained by each dimension.
\item \code{gaps}: Differences between successive eigenvalues.
}
}
\description{
Determines the number of diffusion map dimensions needed to explain a
desired amount of variance. The function automatically discards the
trivial first eigenvalue of the Markov matrix and provides diagnostic
logging of the cumulative variance explained and gaps in the spectrum.
