}
\arguments{
\item{Y_proj_voxel_vector}{Projected data (n x 1) with confounds removed}

\item{X_trial_onset_list_of_matrices}{List of unprojected trial matrices (n x p each)}

\item{H_shape_voxel_vector}{HRF shape (p x 1)}

\item{A_lss_fixed_matrix}{Matrix of fixed regressors used during projection (n x q)}

\item{P_lss_matrix}{Precomputed matrix from \code{prepare_lss_fixed_components_core}}

\item{p_lss_vector}{Precomputed intercept projection vector (unused)}
}
\value{
Vector of trial-wise betas
}
\description{
Computes trial-wise beta estimates using Least Squares Separate (LSS)
for a single voxel. This function delegates the actual LSS computation
to the fmrilss package for improved performance and consistency.

This function is deprecated. Use appropriate LS-A or LS-S functions instead.
}
\details{
The LSS approach fits each trial separately, with all other trials
treated as nuisance regressors. This implementation uses fmrilss::lss()
internally. Note that the input data (Y_proj_voxel_vector) should already
be projected to remove confounds to avoid double projection.
