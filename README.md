# manifold_hrf

Manifold Methods for Hemodynamic Response Function Analysis

## Overview

This package provides manifold learning methods for analyzing hemodynamic response functions (HRF) in neuroimaging data. It implements dimensionality reduction techniques and manifold-based approaches for understanding HRF patterns and dynamics. The package includes a complete pipeline for manifold-guided HRF estimation and trial-wise deconvolution (M-HRF-LSS) with support for neuroimaging data formats.

## Key Features

- **Manifold-guided HRF estimation** using diffusion maps
- **Trial-wise deconvolution** with Least Squares Separate (LSS) 
- **Spatial smoothing** of manifold coordinates
- **Comprehensive QC reporting** with diagnostic plots
- **Integration** with `neuroim2` and `fmrireg` packages
- **Modular design** with separate core computational engine and neuroimaging layer

## Installation
