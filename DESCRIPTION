Authors@R: person("First", "Last", email = "your.email@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides manifold learning methods for analyzing 
    hemodynamic response functions (HRF) in neuroimaging data. It implements 
    dimensionality reduction techniques and manifold-based approaches for 
    understanding HRF patterns and dynamics. The package includes a complete 
    pipeline for manifold-guided HRF estimation and trial-wise deconvolution 
    (M-HRF-LSS) with support for neuroimaging data formats.
